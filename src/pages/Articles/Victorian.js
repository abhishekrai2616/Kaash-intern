            The reign of Queen Victoria spanned the years 1837 to 1901, the era
            of technological advancements. In Victoria&#39;s time, candle lights
            and oil lamps were the only means of lighting houses and buildings.
            While the wealthiest used chandeliers or great candles for special
            occasions, luxury hotels in Italy and Spain were the first to use
            electric lights.&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time candles illuminated
            specific areas or the entire room. By consequence, too much of
            brightness was disturbing and gave the idea of a new source of
            lighting.

            The 1880s also saw circular wick lamps, but as electric lighting
            became prevalent, people ceased using oil lamps in their daily
            lives. In addition, there were hand-blown glass period bulbs
            available. Furthermore, oil lamps and candles were often used alone,
            and electric power was used when there were guests. Consequently,
            the bulbs lasted a long time. Besides, light did not emit any smell,
            unlike oil and candles, so it made for a more pleasant atmosphere
            for people.

            In Victorian homes, wick lamps were quite popular, available flat
            and circular. Unlike other lamps, this has a flame spreader built
            into the burner which allowed the possibility of increasing or
            decreasing the illumination of a candle, hence adapting light levels
            to specific needs. An open ribbon of cotton makes up the wick, as
            capillary action sucked up paraffin oil through the wick, the choice
            to choose paraffin smell further personalised the experience.
            Paraffin was cheaper than fuel, but it wasnâ€™t enough efficient to
            illuminate the entire rooms.

            Lights were first turned on Pall Mall in 1930s, now with energy
            crisis and climate change we are going back to dark ages with
            municipalities switching off the lights. Just like Victorian ages,
            it's time for us to explore new innovations and set an example with
            new technologies to create efficient systems in elder communities.
